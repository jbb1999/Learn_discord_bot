# Learn_discord_bot
This is a discord bot i made! Its supposed to encourage learning! 
To run it you must enter your token in config.py in token = "Token"
You muse change the directory to wherever you are storing your learn info
To add more questions simply copy paste this line
"6": ["other question [true/false].", "true"],
Then change the other question to your question and change the true/false to whatever the 2 choises are or you can make them write a answer but for this it would have to be exactly whats written in true for it to add score, also make the 6 a 7 or 8 depending on how many you wanna add and also on line 46 make the random number gen to howmany questions you have. Last make a new file named num8.txt depending on how many you are adding then write whatever you want in it!
Note you must make a database i recommend installing XAMPP and then makea DB with the layout in layout.png
